Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.

With loops i think the human brain forgets about the index starting at zero. also using the different signs < > or <= >= can effect when the loop finishes. So if you forget the the loop starts at zero rather than one a off by one error will occur

2. Both BalloonGame and Genealogy used another class that was written for you.
This saved you writing some code, but it also constrained you to write the
program in a particular way.  Discuss the advantages and disadvantages you
found when having a predefined class that you had to use as part of your
program.

The advantage is that is makes the programming set up and easier to build the game and so we can focus on the arrays and loops required. I wouldn’t say there was a disadvantage because we are still able to make our own methods if wanted. For the assignment required it having the pre written methods came in handy and i utilised them instead of doubling up and making messy code.


3. Add to your programming "concept map" the additional concepts about
programming and about Java that you have learned this week. (As usual, copy
your answer from last assignment, fixing up any of the descriptions if you have
a better understanding of them now, and add the new concepts you have acquired
this week, along with one sentence descriptions of them. 

I have a better understanding of for loops and i am getting confident making arrays and array-lists. With the array lists I forget about some of the methods that are available. 
I like using the for each the most.
I am comfortable scanning a file and using a while loop to check it. 
I learnt about recursion calling the method within the method - for ancestors and decendants. 
I learnt how to use do while loops - to check if the disks overlapped
It would have been nice to have gotten the keys working but my mac wasn’t up for it.
I used a boolean to jump out of the second loop to stop the gun firing. 
I am getting used to making more methods and calling them to make the code cleaner.
