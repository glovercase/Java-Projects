Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. For the FrogGame class, you had to choose fields to store the states of the
frogs and the cars. There are several reasonable choices for this, not just the
suggested one. What other choices could you have made? What would the
consequences of your choice be when you came to write the methods - what would
be easier the suggested way, and what would be easier the other way? 


2. For MiniPaint, you had to work out how to make event-driven input work. What
was difficult? Was it more difficult than the previous programs? If so, in what
way?

3. Add to your programming "concept map" the additional concepts about
programming and about Java that you have learned this week. (As usual, copy
your answer from last assignment, fixing up any of the descriptions if you have a
better understanding of them now, and add the new concepts you have acquired
this week, along with one sentence descriptions of them.
