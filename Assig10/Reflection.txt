
This was the last assignment for COMP102.  Think back to the beginning of the
course and what you knew at that point, and then list some of the new skills
and understanding that you believe that you have gained during this course.

It is hard to believe how fast the tri has gone. At the start of the course I knew very little about programming and the language Java. I had seen if statements and for loops and that my only understanding of programming. I didnâ€™t understand the idea of object orientated programming and it took me a few weeks for it to sink in. I have learnt a lot on this course. But still need help here and there. The plan over the break is to practice  often and keep learning to hopefully have a head start for next tri. Will go back through the old assignments and see if i can get all the challenges. I can confidently talk about most of the concepts that we have learnt. Bring on the EXAM!!!

[For some of you who are still finding the course difficult, you could
try doing some of the early assignments again; you may find them an awful lot
easier the second time round, demonstrating that you have learned stuff!]
